# Am I clicking?

A [webpage](http://amiclicking.xyz) to check if clicks are registered properly.
Supports touch-screens as well.

## Why do we need this?
I was asked by [Razer](https://www.razer.com/) Support to provide a video showing how my mouse releases the button early. Turns out this is not quite as easy to do. Hence this webpage.
